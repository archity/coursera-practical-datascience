-1,A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. i'm not sure what they were thinking.,Blouses
-1,I ordered a small  which is my usual retailer size  but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long  a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.,Blouses
-1,I loved fabric  print and back detail. design  however  was a little too boxy to be flattering on me. even at great price i sent it back.,Blouses
-1,I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft    but the pattern is undistinguished.   the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy  the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.,Blouses
-1,This looked like a simple  chic blouse  but the fabric felt cheap to me  like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.,Blouses
-1,"I wanted to love this top  but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it  and while i love the pattern  the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms  and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference  i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes  and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to",Blouses
-1,The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory  but the top in reality is more beige. well  i'm blonde with fair skin  so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality  with it really being beige  having pleats everywhere  and being a crinkly fabric  it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts,Blouses
-1,Disappointed  the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.,Blouses
-1,Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews  even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black  you could probably get away with it  but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.,Blouses
0,The picture of this top is misleading. it's more like a tent/ super short dress. i ordered my usual size (l) and could easily get away with a small in this top  if the arm holes were not too tight. i def. need to go down to a medium  and maybe even a petite medium since i'm 5/3. the top is 100% cotton  but there is so much fabric there is no way a little shrinkage would offset the amount of extra fabric. it looks like a tent on. plus  the picture and description make it seem like a normal top le,Blouses
0,"I got my usual xs (i'm a 32b) and the top fit fine from the chest up. my head just fits through the hole on top without having to unbutton. but then from the chest down  the shirt billows out too far. it hits me at the hip like the model (i'm 5'6"" and wear 2/26) but because of the extra fabric it really needs to be longer to balance out the trapeze look. since the top portion fits nicely i almost want to keep it then have a seamstress take it in a little at the waist so it's more a-line than tra",Blouses
0,Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!,Blouses
0,Bought this top at my local store and tried it on as soon as i got home. yikes! it was way too billowy  i looked like i was pregnant. will be trying the next size down on in the store to see if it is billowy.,Blouses
0,The fit is a little bit odd  it is short and wide  too much fabric. the quality is not good  the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart. i am returning it.,Blouses
0,The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty  but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest  it was very unflattering.,Blouses
0,The color of this top is lovely. however  i felt the quality was lacking for the price. the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already. fit was tts for me.,Blouses
0,The button detail on the sides is a unique design detail. i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides. but i decided against purchasing this top  it appeared shapeless on me. i have a curvier/athletic figure  and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure.,Blouses
0,I really wanted to love this top when i got it  but not so much. it fit nicely through the bust and torso  but flared out way too much  it ended up looking like a maternity top. maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape. another thing  it was very low cut  i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath. the fabric didn't seem to be the best quality  it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package. this shirt was not worth the price. sadly  this was a mis,Blouses
1,The green is a deep  beautiful shade. the fabric and fir is very flattering!,Blouses
1,This is an ideal top - especially for summer. so lightweight and soft! the detailing is adorable and makes this simple shirt feel very special  yet everyday! i ordered the black  and am back for the other colors! this one is an absolute win.,Blouses
1,I love this top. the quality is topnotch and it's true to size. it's not skintight but it's also not so roomy that you look pregnant! one thing that surprised me is that it's a silk material. i thought it was linen or something like that. but i love it!,Blouses
1,This is sure to become my favorite shirt! this shirt is feminine and the fit is perfect. the white lace is strategically placed  so you do not have to wear a cami on those hot summer days  but you can for the work day. i cannot wait to wear this!!,Blouses
1,Cute but classy top because of the embroidery at the bottom!,Blouses
1,The colors on my monitor are not true to the product  and that was disappointing to me. that being said  and it is important because this will not go with the pants and skirts that i intended  it is a very good quality blouse especially at the sale price. all cut edges and seams are bound. the detailing is very good. i wish it was silk instead of polyester  however. the buttons appear in the photo to be shell--in reality they are covered buttons. the print is odd and will be difficult to style.,Blouses
1,This is a really beautiful top. the colors are lovely a subtle. it is larger than i expected. i ordered a small which is my usual size and it is more of a baggy tunic. it still works because the material is so sheer  but does not fit me like the photo size down,Blouses
1,I loved this tunic. dress up or down layer it with a cropped leather jacket and booties. i bit on the long side so if you are short it might make you look stumpy but really cute with leggings or skinny jeans.,Blouses
1,Truthfully  i wouldn't have looked twice at this shirt online. i came across it at my local retailer store and i'm so glad i did. the colors are more vivid and beautiful in person. i purchased the small (my normal size) and it hits at the waist.,Blouses
-1,"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2""  115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however  i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress  i was first shocked that for the price  the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on  it was clear that th",Dresses
-1,I went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.,Dresses
-1,I love eva franco   this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled   felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.,Dresses
-1,You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.,Dresses
-1,"I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2"". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back.",Dresses
-1,I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun  but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline,Dresses
-1,I have always bought interesting  pretty  wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.,Dresses
-1,I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door  but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly  so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow  but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.,Dresses
-1,This dress has a great shape and fabric - but the v neckline is too deep/low and the arm holes are also cut too low. would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return.,Dresses
0,"I am 5'-7"" and 135 lbs  i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees  instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length...",Dresses
0,I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.,Dresses
0,First of all  the colors are really pretty  fabrics feel really nice. but.... the fit was no bueno. i think if you are tall and small chested  this dress would look great. but i'm short and large chested and it was very unflattering. when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid  it doesn't hang nicely due to my chest. sadly this is a return for me.,Dresses
0,Yummy  soft material  but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like  then this is for you.,Dresses
0,I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge  i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design.,Dresses
0,I really liked the color and style of this dress  but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!,Dresses
0,This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn't really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however  if you have a larger chest (i'm a 34c)  the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well.,Dresses
0,I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived  i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size  so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e.  too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress,Dresses
0,This dress arrived with a black rope belt and belt loops. i did not see this in the photo. i thought it was a throw-on-and-go dress  not a belted dress. this  in addition to the weird sizing  caused me to return it. i am a size 4-6 in dresses and the size small i ordered was skin tight and bunched at the hips.,Dresses
1,"Love love love this jumpsuit! normally i stay away from jumpsuits because i hate to have to completely undress to use the bathroom  but this was too cute to pass up. fits great  extremely flattering to my athletic build  super comfy. it sort of looks like a maxi-dress due to the wide legs. length was perfect. i am 5'3"" and did not have to hem it.",Dresses
1,I'm not a big fan of rompers but love this one. it is very flattering and comfortable. i love that you can dress it up with some heels and accessorizes or more casual with flats.,Dresses
1,If you're not a petite and are reading this  read on :) i'm always on the lookout in the petite section because many times us fuller girls can fit into these.   ________  pros:  - tts for me. i'm normally a size 10/12 (m/l) in the regular sizes. i tried on the 12p and it fit everywhere perfectly  especially at the bust in which i'm a 36c.  - fabric is on the thicker side  but that's what gives it this adorable shape  besides already being fit-and-flare.  - pockets :) i always lean towards dresse,Dresses
1,I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was!  it is an absolute must-have!,Dresses
1,As soon as i saw this dress online  i knew i wanted it!  i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neck/shoulders.  i ordered online  and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress.  i am 5'5 and it hits just an inch above my knee.  it's the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event!,Dresses
1,Love this dress! the other reviews were accurate. it is a lot of fabric and i can't decide whether i will actually use the belt that it came with. but i think it would be a great  beachy dress for the summer.,Dresses
1,Comfortable  relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!,Dresses
1,"This dress is so beautiful. i am 50 5'8"" and smaller on top larger on bottom. size 6 is perfect! was worried that it would hit me in all the wrong places. happy to say it does not. wore it for the first time yesterday and no lie i received no less than 15 compliments from strangers. just walked up to tell me how great the dress was. colors are so soft and beautiful. would buy in other colors if they had it. i can see myself wearing it to a casual dinner  to a wedding our just to feel special on",Dresses
1,This dress is so soft and comfortable. great winter staple. i purchased the blue motif  which really doesn't have any blue on it. the stripes are fun and make this the perfect dress to throw on and feel great while staying comfortable.,Dresses
-1,"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic  but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling  ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer.",Fine gauge
-1,Based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath,Fine gauge
-1,I read the existing reviews  before purchasing  and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium  i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short  does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference  i am 5'6''  medium build,Fine gauge
-1,Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in. i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.,Fine gauge
-1,I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted  they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned.,Fine gauge
-1,"The color of the sweater is beautiful  but the fit was awful. it was too ""swingy"" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly  (i'm 5'1""  108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item.",Fine gauge
-1,Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.,Fine gauge
-1,It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline  but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also  the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.,Fine gauge

0,So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it  i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing  the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l  so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug  but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look  so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too  but i could have rolle,Fine gauge
0,This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,Fine gauge
0,Loved this top  but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality,Fine gauge
0,It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.,Fine gauge
0,I didn't realize it had a tie around the waist. it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist. unfortunately the sash is attached and cannot be removed. it's very cute; just not for me.  i will have to return (but sure i can find something else)!,Fine gauge
0,I bought three of these this summer--a mint  ivory  and yellow. when i received them  they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but  then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap  outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside,Fine gauge
0,This sweater is much more cropped than shown. the sweater i received was only 24 inches long. the color of the trim is black  not the navy or plum that i expected. quality does seem good.,Fine gauge
0,I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower,Fine gauge
1,"This is the cutest sweater. i bought it today in black. i cannot wait to wear it. it is a lovely  distinctive knit & just the right weight to layer as shown with a white blouse or with a turtleneck. i tried both the xs and s; and i decided to go with the s as it still emphasized that i have waist  but i could layer it nicely. i am 5'4""  130 lb. you can always count on angel of the north for great style.",Fine gauge
1,I love this sweater! i ordered the dark gray and wasn't expecting fabulous but that's what i got. the skirt below the waist tie is actually pleated so that it falls perfectly. the seaming detail is beautiful. i am between a size large and extra large and the extra large fit perfectly. the sweater is short  half way down my hips but looks good over a long tank. this a medium weight knit and will be wearable all year with skirts  dresses and any kind of trousers. this is one of my favorite purchas,Fine gauge
1,"This 'poor boy' mock t-neck/high crew neck top looks a tiny bit more olive to me than the online photos. the fit runs on the smaller size  and the sleeves will be bracelet length or 3/4 length for taller women. . i tried a size xs that was in the store and it fit with the sleeves just above my wrists  but a size s would have been fine too (i'm 5'2""  currently 33-25-37  narrow shoulders and torso).for reference  even the size m of the short sleeve version fit fine  so there is a lot of give. . no",Fine gauge
1,Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my 15 year old daughter. purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it! she wore today with suede booties-very soft  cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens. she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall.,Fine gauge
1,"Look carefully at the pics of the back. if this style and the color suit you  just go ahead and order this one. it looks just like the pics  and is light  comfortable and true to size. the kind of top you can throw on when you are in a hurry and look great. however  because the back is sheer from halfway down  maybe not for work if you work in an office. moth is one of my favorite brands at retailer and this one is easy-peasy. i am 5'3""  34c/28/38 and ordered the regular s.",Fine gauge
1,Love this sweater! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease. very soft and seems durable. i highly recommend it!,Fine gauge
1,This sweater is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured in terms of fit  length  and color. the fabric is super soft and not at all itchy - feels soft like a boucle type knit. the sleeves are 3/4 length and the weight is maybe a medium-weight (not super warm). i wouldn't see this taking me too far into a northeastern winter  but for right now it's perfect!! fit is tts :),Fine gauge
1,Comfy and lightweight - beautiful blue color. sleeves are a bit long but not a bother to me.,Fine gauge
1,Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well.,Fine gauge
-1,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Intimates
-1,This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.,Intimates
-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return,Intimates
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates
-1,3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,Intimates
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,Intimates

-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates

1,This bra is very cute and pretty comfortable. i usually wear between a 34d in elle mcpherson and this fit perfect. i got it in black and while it's really cute i was surprised how different the color looked in person vs. online. online it looked to me to have some purple to it  but it is definitely 100% black in person (just an fyi). i also thought the tassel was cute  but it does look a little cheap and flimsy in person. still a great bra.,Intimates
1,Yes  this is a thinner bra  it's almost sheer when you hold it up to the light  but it fit perfectly (36d) and is seamless under even the thinnest tops. i love that its not padded  i feel like it just slightly enhances my natural shape without adding anything more  and i really wish i had bought multiples before they sold out! i can't speak to how it will hold up since i just got it yesterday and i'm wearing it for the first time today  but i'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will last as wel,Intimates

1,I own many of the natori feathers back close bras and decided to try the front close version for spring/summer tops and dresses. i purchased the yellow and got the matching hipsters panty. i no longer see the yellow available but you could find elsewhere or maybe retailer will bring this color back (it is lovely!)? for sizing  i tried my normal size (34b) and the cup size larger per other reviews. the 34c did end up fitting better so i also recommend going up a cup size. excited for warmer weather,Intimates
1,Cute little sleep mask! the elastic band is wide so it doesn't ever feel like it's digging into your head. does a very good job keeping out light.,Intimates
1,A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!,Intimates
-1,Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for,Jackets
-1,"I have been looking for an off-white vest and thought this one would be perfect  except it is going back. i am 5'9"" 150 lbs. medium is my normal top size  but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture. no buttons  so no way to close it. unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo. not worth the price.",Jackets
-1,This is so close to perfect  but there's a seam down the middle of the back and they didn't bother to match the polka dots. you can see the mismatch in the second photo. i was about to buy the jacket  and totally in love  when i turned and saw the error. i hoped it was one bad match  but nope  on every one. couldn't unsee  didn't buy. very disappointed.,Jackets
-1,The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!,Jackets
-1,Love the idea of this top  but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap. the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $20 at a market abroad. definitely disappointed with the quality for the price. will be retuning.,Jackets
-1,I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.,Jackets
-1,I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,Jackets
-1,I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.,Jackets
-1,This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there  this went back,Jackets
0,It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.,Jackets
0,The jacket was nice and soft but it was too short on my torso with a cropped fit which i'm not a fan of that style. i returned it.,Jackets
0,This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!,Jackets
0,Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow  waaay too small.,Jackets
0,The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it  then it might be for you  but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.,Jackets
0,I ordered two of these  the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference  i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me  the style was just off. i had to return both.,Jackets
0,I had such high hopes for this jacket based on the photo  i even waited for it to come back in stock. the detail is beautiful but it is shapeless and boxy. for reference i ordered xs  and i am usually a 0/2 on top (small chested). it might look better on someone with a larger chest but looked like a sack on me. so disappointing.,Jackets
0,"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however  is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the",Jackets
0,This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,Jackets
1,Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist  but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into).     it's quickly become a great staple for work. definitely pair it with bodycon pants/ leggings/ skinny jeans - and it looks unique and very professional.,Jackets
1,I love the soft  slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order  the green version had sold out. as it turns out  the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today  but i wore it anyway!,Jackets
1,I love this jacket! i was hesitant to order  but i'm so glad i did. it's such a cute  unique blazer to add to my wardrobe. fit is very true to size for a blazer.,Jackets
1,Purchased as a gift  but needed to return due to recipient weight challenged in past 6 months. heavier material of neutral tone ( with detailing of epaulets) pairs well with dresses  skirts  jeans  jeggings and whatever style of boots. veratile garment and will re-purchase for self in future.,Jackets
1,I love the look and design of this piece but the fit is awkward. the m gapes open and is much boxier than it looks on the model but the s is too tight in the elbows. i think i might have to return it :(,Jackets
1,Ooo la la! sooo chic! sooo retailer!!,Jackets
1,I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!,Jackets
1,"I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2"" but 36d and have 31"" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the",Jackets
1,First saw this jacket in the catalog  in peach  and had to have it. i received it today  and love it. its a soft  muted peach  very neutral. i ordered xl  im usually a m-l  but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great  feels good on. love it so much  i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket  will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces  never disappoints.,Jackets
-1,Bummer  i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.,Jeans
-1,So after reading the 2 reviews  decided to just order my usual size (26)  thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style  so bummed!,Jeans
-1,So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely,Jeans
-1,"Woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no  no  no!",Jeans
-1,"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser  less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie.",Jeans
-1,I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.,Jeans
-1,I love the coh fleetwood jeans  and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans  i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods  which are a substantial weight denim  these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in  these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.,Jeans
-1,These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.,Jeans
-1,Love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom:) these jeans have a 23 inch inseam not 26  so they hit at a very odd place on my calf- return. for reference i'm 5'8 ,Jeans
0,I love the style  but it didn't work for me. i ordered the r size. they were way too too long. i generally wear size 26  and the r length works with most retailer pants. with this particular pant  i could barely pull up the zipper. i'm not sure what happened bc i haven't gained any additional weight. i am 5'2  and 110 lbs. unfortunately  i had to return the pants. i think the design is for supermodels. maybe a petite size would have worked? the p was out of stock. good luck!,Jeans
0,"The fit is definitely more ""straight-leg "" and not skinny  as the photos seem to imply. at 4'11"" and 95 lbs  the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully  and the length was great  but the jean lost shape at the knee. i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit!",Jeans
0,As other reviewers have pointed out  the bum is not flattering. the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out. bummer. literally. too bad  i wanted these to work more than then coh's parker cropped. the coh's win. my wallet loses.,Jeans
0,I don't think they are an easy fit cut  they are more like skinny jeans. as i was looking for something more relaxed i decided to return them. the quality of the material is good  the color is nice.,Jeans
0,I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made  but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris  these were cartoonishly wide.  needless to say  they were returned.,Jeans
0,These jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable. i can't recommemd them though because they're see through. wish white jeans were better lined so that this isn't usually a problem!,Jeans
0,The color on these are amazing. i am 5'2 and these are really meant for that long lean profile. note they have very little stretch.,Jeans
0,"The tag on the jeans said ""won't stretch out""  and i've already returned one pair to size down when they stretched out by the end of the first wear. ive been wearing the smaller size for a week  and it's stretching out as well. the crotch ends up dropping two or 3 inches and i keep having to hike the pants up in public  after just a week of owning them. i love paige jeans  and the cut and color of these are amazing. i'm going to have to size down one last time just to get them to stay up  i hope",Jeans
0,I love j brand  however the fit of these jeans was all wrong for me. they were perfect from the knee up  however they stuck out too much at the bottom. a slight taper from the knee down would have made them perfect. i had to return them.,Jeans
1,I honestly  have to give these jeans 5stars.  i loved them when i saw them in the store and had to have them and when i wore them  i got tons of compliments. they are super comfortable too!  i read some of the other reviews and thought that their comments were a little strange.  these jeans are obviously not classic and they will go of style but  if you run a little outside of the style box you will welcome them in your wardrobe.,Jeans
1,I found these jeans on the sale rack at my local retailer. they were the very last pair and in my size. i couldn't believe my luck.  i tried them on and was very impressed with the fit and feel of the jeans. thyre soft yet substantial. they retain thier shape. . love the worn in look to them.  .. .. so adorable.  nice slouchy skinny jean.. i stayed true to size,Jeans
1,Adore these jeans! great length  cute cuffed details. could do cartwheels in these :),Jeans
1,Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days  while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-2 sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.,Jeans
1,"I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it ""runs small"" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!",Jeans

-1,I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around.

-1,I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute  but it was huge  shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews.,Knits
-1,I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.,Knits
-1,I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn  and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans  or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!,Knits
-1,"This top is very beautiful and the color is a dream  but wow is it short! i'm 5'8"" and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans. the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected. it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse.     because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt  i wouldn't recommend this to women who are busty/curvy on top. it made my chest look huge! this styling may work for petite ladies  but tall & curvy ladies beware.",Knits
-1,I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design  but the sleeves made this a quick return ....,Knits
-1,I want to love this shirt  i really do  but it's huge! the top is tent-like  which would be adorable with skinny jeans  however the length of the back dips so low  the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful  more like a light grey heather  and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall  the top is cute  but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt  so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly  it's a return.,Knits
-1,The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful  but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest  but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so,Knits
-1,I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee  but failed in quality and value. it was returned.,Knits
0,Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues  gold  neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.,Knits
0,I was hoping to find a slimming and cozy sweater  unfortunately this one was baggy and material was really bulky. one of those occasions where i would have never purchased this in person but online you can't quite tell the style and fit. i returned this item.,Knits
0,This top fit me great across the bust - true to size there  however  it was very loose other than that (outside of the peplum of course). it did not seem flattering for my body shape/did not give me much shape on top. i was wider than i should be/am. this may work on some body types  but did not work for me. it was a nice feeling  comfortable top however.,Knits
0,I love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it. i would have realized the front and back are different materials  which i am not a fan of. i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back. it's like a mullet  business in the front and party in the back. it's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though  so into rotation it goes.,Knits
0,I need t-shirts  these seem cute. a small runs loose  but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist  because these shirts are cut generously  the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store  but left them all there.,Knits
0,"Gorgeous sleeves  flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much  i decided to buy it  knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these ""easy breezy"" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture  i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh",Knits
0,I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing  the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash  too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.,Knits
0,Boxy  unflattering  and large.  i'm 5'2'' and a curvy 135 pounds. this top (size s) swallowed me  had no shape  and the material didn't feel great either. i wouldn't even purchase it on sale--there are other graphic tees that are much nicer. i'll be sticking to splendid and sundry.,Knits
0,"I bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it's not too sheer. the back detail is great. my only complaint is that it is too long. i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top  but it is much longer on me than on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. it doesn't look great when i do a half tuck  but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in. maybe an xs would have been a better fit.",Knits
1,"The neutral color was at my local retailer  which is a rich brown/mocha  much nicer looking in person. like others  this is quite sheer and thin. however  it is so stretchy  breathable  and comfortable that i would use this for layering instead. for my 5'9""  36c  hourglass frame  i found the medium to be rather body hugging. it was not at all loose like on the model. for me  this is fine because i will layer  eliminating issues of sheerness.",Knits

1,Love this shirt! looks great with a pair of black work slacks or with jeans. very flattering with the banded hem  and the material is soft.,Knits
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering

-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering
-1,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,Layering
-1,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,Layering

0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

1,I was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings  plus fleece. instead  they're more like thicker-than-average tights. still warm  though there's a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort. not so bad that i want to return them  but not what i was hoping for  either.,Legwear

1,This product is awesome! i'm a tall lady with wide calves and thighs and these socks look and feel fantastic on me; they are tight enough that they don't wind up sliding down around my ankles  but not so snug that they make my legs look like sausages. i would recommend this product to all of my girlfriends.,Legwear
1,These tights are light but at the same time super cozy. definitely cut and sewn as tights and not meant to be worn as leggings -- they're really sheer around your rump. i've worn them around the house with oversized t-shirts and long sweaters. would only wear out of the house with a dress or serious coverage  despite what i thought when i bought them. i wish they were available in a few more colors. worth the sale price.,Legwear

1,This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering  but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all  it's just a very good design.   note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear  without being visible  into the sleeve when they are not being used. also  the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used  so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).,Lounge

0,Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle  and front pleats to make me fluffy  i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller  this may look good on you.,Pants
0,"I think these are amazing for anyone over  say  5'5"". the way these hung on me (at 5'2"") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass.",Pants
0,This runs huge  not large  huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10  150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered  but now its just too much of a hassle,Pants
0,I tried this in an xxsp. i am normally an ssxp or xsp. it fit me well everywhere except in the crotch where i was given a slight wedgie. not the look i was going for. if i sized up  the rest of the jumpsuit would be too large on my frame.     also  i don?t feel the quality matched the price point. the one i received had a lot of loose stings already and it was unopened previously. that being said  it is a beautiful color and on the right body  the style would work well. it just wasn?t for me.,Pants
0,I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored.,Pants
1,These are fantastic  great fit  super comfortable material and perfect length (petite). i ordered the carbon to have a neutral pair  but i also want the other colors! 0p fit 26.5 in waist  115 lbs. length on petite is enough to have a small heel) i have short legs).,Pants
1,"I love a jumpsuit for its ease of dressing. this is the 3rd i've purchased from retailer. material is thin and gauzy as described. with a sweater or jacket it will be plenty warm for so cal winters and great the rest of the year. if you are all tall  the waist might fall a bit short. i am 5'6"" and the waist just barely hits my waistline. doubt i would have purchased this item full price  but on sale it's a great deal.",Pants
1,These are very nice pants. good quality and as expected. however  they do run small. i generally wear a small or size 4  sometimes a 2 depending on the maker. on average a 4. these i measured were 0 to 2 sizing. sending back and going a size up.,Pants
1,I was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband  but i love them. they feel wonderful  yet they are so light. perfect for warm weather. the print takes them from day to night.,Pants
1,I love  love this wide leg pants! they feel beautiful on and fit like a glove. i do think they run a bit small in the waist  because they were a bit too tight in my regular size. typically  cloths are a little too large in the waist on me (i have a curvy/athletic figure). as other reviewers stated  they pants are long  but they are great length for wedges. otherwise  i would recommend having the length tailored.,Pants
1,The quality is there. these pants are just as pictured. very wide leg  romantic pants. the pockets lay nicely inside so as not to be bunchy like some pants do. these fit perfect and look great.,Pants
1,"I love these pants. i vary between 10 & 12  the 10 fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size  perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom. so many colors to coordinate with these pants. teal green  ""retailer"" yellow  black...i am not fond of ankle pants  prefer longer pants. i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants. the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made  removing the cuff tacks was a challenge! perfect pants for those of us who have shape",Pants

1,They're the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year. easy purchase!,Pants
-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.,Shorts
-1,Beware. white is not white. white is more cream  off-white  light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute  but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also  the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.,Shorts
-1,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!,Shorts
-1,I've been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure  they're great when you try them on in the store..soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a,Shorts

-1,Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!,Shorts
-1,I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly  no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them  they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer. the lace is man,Shorts

-1,Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture.,Shorts
0,The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.,Shorts
0,When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on,Shorts
0,I wanted to like this romper  it is very cute and colorful  but to top was overywhelming for my size and made me look even shorter.,Shorts
0,I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area  then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.,Shorts
0,I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.,Shorts
0,"I'm 5'4""  130 lbs  curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on  they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite  curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area.",Shorts
0,"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors  fabric  and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.",Shorts
0,I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice   but if it sits at my natural waist   the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad   i love the print and ease of this design.,Shorts
0,I fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day  but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere  so i had to return it.,Shorts
1,One of my first rompers  it's super cute. i need to get used to the puffy sleeves but my husband also really likes it and he's definitely got an opinion about these things.,Shorts
1,I absolutely adore these shorts and pick a few colors every year. like last year  these do run big so do size down. the length is perfect to roll them as much as you like. they look great after washing and wish they came in more brighter colors. love these and highly recommend these!,Shorts
1,These fit quite well  and it's rare that i find shorts that fit well without being too tight. great for spring or summer. fits tts.,Shorts
1,Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.,Shorts
1,This romper is one of my favorite purchases. the material is great  the fit is very forgiving  and it is very comfortable. it is easily dressed up or down. i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well.,Shorts
1,Nice fit  stretchy fabric  but they do not stretch out of shape or so much that they are too big after wearing for a few hours. very true to size and great length. i am going to buy another pair because i know once i wear these out i will want a back-up!,Shorts
1,Sleeves were a bit too long and the size was too big but it's really cute and if they had a smaller size i would definitely have exchanged!,Shorts
1,I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.,Shorts

-1,This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!,Skirts
-1,"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition  the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery  tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted  it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me  not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past  including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews  but have no regret",Skirts
-1,I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me  it was too much. wish it worked!,Skirts
-1,"I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however  after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6""  size 4  hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure.",Skirts
-1,The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip  it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.,Skirts
-1,I was so excited to get this in the mail  and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up  but i don't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not  but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.,Skirts
-1,"This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a ""life ""in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or i better say  it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately  it stretched more than a full size  and generally lost its shape. now  the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore.",Skirts

0,So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.,Skirts
0,Love everything about this skirt but the sizing. i'm a size 6/medium in almost everything but this skirt swallowed me. i wise there was a small or even extra small to try out. i'm also 5'5 and the skirt was right at my knees. definitely size down if you want it to look like the pictures.,Skirts

0,Already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt. great fun shape  very flattering. however  the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down (you can literally feel it through the liner and i'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it). very poor attention to details...,Skirts
0,It is a very pretty skirt but arrived extremely wrinkled and the waist is very fitted. overall i probably would not have purchased it if i had actually seen it in the store.,Skirts
0,I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok  something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.,Skirts
0,This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice  the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.,Skirts
1,I ordered my usual 0p  and this skirt seemed a little long for me. the 00p might also have fit if higher on the waist  as it hung a little  so in that sense  if you prefer higher waisted skirts  you can size down (i am 115 lbs  26.5-27 in waist). the cut is nice and does flare out  but the one i received was folded and you could see the folds... so it didn't do the skirt justice. the top layer is almost off white  while the under skirt is pink  so that is a nice contrast. the appliquã© is pretty,Skirts
1,Great detailing in how it's made. may look best on someone who's slender. it runs small and will show if you have even slight curves.,Skirts
1,Almost the perfect skirt! great colors super cute fit very flattering great length very versatile. only issue was size; normally a solid 10  i ended up a full 2 sizes smaller. very stretchy and comfortable just try it on first or order a couple of sizes. go down at least 1 size. as others have said...pilcro strikes again its such a great brand with the most flattering shapes and fabrics.,Skirts
1,I absolutely love this skirt! i feel like the color works well for most seasons: you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months  or layer it with a sweater  thick tights and boots in autumn. really nice staple piece for your wardrobe. i do think it runs a bit large: i generally wear a 6 (depending on the brand and style)  but this 6 was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches. i returned it and got a 4  which fit me perfectly. it's nice that,Skirts
1,First mermaid-ish skirt ever that's flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body. the material is light-weight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment. the color is a rich  deep  gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it. runs large so size down.,Skirts
1,I absolutely loooove this skirt! its just as depicted. super comfy and warm. got tons of compliments wearing it. its just adorable. the colors are really rich and the design if the skirt made it avery flexible to wear with different styles of tops and sweaters. highly recommend!!,Skirts
1,"I love this skirt! i wasn't sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works! it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too! the quality is great - the skirt is a fine silk  ant it is lined  so you don't need a slip. i think it fits perfectly for my body type  and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing  it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway. i am normally a 0 petite  5'2""  104  waist 24.5""  hips 34",Skirts

-1,Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.,Sleep
-1,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down.,Sleep

0,The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece  either way  i'll be sending it in for return.,Sweaters
0,"When i saw this  i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year. the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality (would wash well)  but it's pretty lightweight. the fit is huge...could easily size down. i'm 5'7"" 128# and found the small to be loose everywhere  including the arms. the length was at my knees  and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest. no idea what i'd wear this with even if it fit better. sadly  it's going",Sweaters
0,"I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front ""collar"" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open  folded over  partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area.",Sweaters

0,Really love this sweater. i am pretty crushed i'm returning it. the flair below the waist is too much. the quality is wonderful  the color lovely  the style great- i wore it around the house and every time i caught a mirror  it just was too much material  too big a bell shape. oh well  still looking for the sweater for winter 2016/17.,Sweaters
0,Love the color  cut  and weight (its like a fleece-weight coat  but longer and more appropriate for an office.)  within two wears one of the buttons popped off.  within three wears  one of the back shoulder seams had split.  this coat is lovely but shoddily made. worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew  because minor repairs will be in your future. it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality.,Sweaters
0,I have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web  i immediately ordered it. on the website  it looks very modern and edgy chic. i was heartbroken when i saw it in person. when i opened the bag and put on the sweater  i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor. it came from the sweater. size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders  which supposed to look modern...well  the thin cheap material the sweater looks like it's ripped.,Sweaters

1,I put this runs small but it's a little more tts  except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model  you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters  which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out  but th,Sweaters
1,The sweater looks cute if you get the right size. it meant to look a little oversized  i think. the color is pretty in person  however it looks different online and in person so keep that in mind. the material is very warm and a little itchy you will need to wear it over a long sleeve undershirt. the look is nice but it is for a cold day.,Sweaters
1,I tried this on in the store and almost considered buying it until i looked at the price tag. i think it's unique and interesting. i just don't think it's worth the $$$. the fabric is nothing special and the construction is not complicated enough to warrant the cost. i would consider it on sale. retailer has more interesting sweaters made with softer blends for a similar price - all things considered i don't think it's a smart purchase.,Sweaters
1,Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn't know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven't worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i'm usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it's a great buy especially since it's on sale now.,Sweaters
1,"I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here  more a grey and purplish colour  beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages  it is soft  comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater.",Sweaters
1,Love the color of this- a rich  dark green- it is super cozy and perfect to throw a long sleeved shirt under- it is roomy  not fitted. i ordered a small  then thought i should have ordered an xs - so then i ordered an xs as well. i go between xs and small  but because this is not fitted  the xs is perfect. material is nice- soft and super cozy.,Sweaters
1,"It's no surprise that this sweater coat is getting five stars. it's beautifully made  has a fun pattern  and fits great.  i purchased the xs (regular size). there weren't any of the petite sizes left for me but the xs fits perfectly. the sleeves hit at my wrist (i'm 5'2"") while the length hits right at the top of my knees. i did notice that the shoulder width could be too tight if you are a more broad person.  the colors are accurate to the website and catalog. this seems so extremely versatile",Sweaters

-1,The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.,Swim

-1,The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.,Swim
-1,Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.,Swim
-1,Loved the material and the style. unfortunately  my fears came true when i received this swimsuit  and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d  i thought the halter would be enough support  however  the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!,Swim
-1,I'm disappointed in these pants  which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren't as nice  the fabric is too thin  and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn't good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them  so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit  they might wo,Swim
-1,The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,Swim

0,I love this swimsuit - the color  the pattern and the coverage! the material is different for me  but easy to get on and off. my complaint is that  although the backside looks great  there is no padding in the front. for a full coverage suit  this leaves little to the imagination. i'm torn on finding justification to keep it.,Swim
0,I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however  the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top  and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price  i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.,Swim

1,This is a really nice suit. it fits well and is slimming with the cross waist. it's also supportive in the bust even  and maybe especially  because it doesn't have moulded cups or underwire  which allows for flexible sizing. the back rises high enough that it supports around the chest as well as from the halter straps. the straps are wide too so they don't dig in and are comfortable. the look is subtle and feminine in the black and the quality is good. it is true to size  but might run a tad lar,Swim
